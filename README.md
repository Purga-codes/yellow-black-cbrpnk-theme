## About this website template

> <b>"Yellow-black cbrpnk theme"</b> is a theme for your website designed with Cyberpunk aesthetic (and, specifially, Cyberpunk 2077) in mind.
<br>In fact, the color theme is loosely inspired by the Cyberpunk 2077's data breach UI.

Since this theme was <b>made for use on neocities/nekoweb/similar websites</b>, <b><i>it is frontend-only</b></i>.

## This template includes:
- <b>html template</b> with the site's structure (<i>adapted for mobile use as well</i>)
- <b>css stylesheet</b> with all the styles
- <b>javascript scripts</b> for some popups (<i>if you don't like them, you can just <b>unlink them from an html file</b> (don't forget to <b>delete the stuff inside "data-breach-popup" and "data-breach-complete" divs!</b>) and then <b>delete the corresponding .js file from the folder</b></i>)
- folder with fonts used (you can find the exact same fonts on google fonts and link them via url. I myself don't find this method comfortable)

## Technologies used:
- <b>html</b>
- <b>css</b>
- <b>vanilla javascript</b>
